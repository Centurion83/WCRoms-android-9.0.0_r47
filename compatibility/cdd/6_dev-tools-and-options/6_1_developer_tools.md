## 6.1\. Developer Tools

Device implementations:

*   [C-0-1] MUST support the Android Developer Tools provided in the Android
SDK.
*   [**Android Debug Bridge (adb)**](http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html)
    *   [C-0-2] MUST support adb as documented in the Android SDK and the shell
        commands provided in the AOSP, which can be used by app developers,
        including [`dumpsys`](https://source.android.com/devices/input/diagnostics.html)
        and `cmd stats`.
    *   [C-0-3] MUST NOT alter the format or the contents of device system
        events (batterystats , diskstats, fingerprint, graphicsstats, netstats,
        notification, procstats) logged via the dumpsys command.
    *   [C-0-10] MUST record, without ommmission, and make the following events
        accessible and available to the `cmd stats` shell command and the
        `StatsManager` System API class.
        *   ActivityForegroundStateChanged
        *   AnomalyDetected
        *   AppBreadcrumbReported
        *   AppCrashOccurred
        *   AppStartOccurred
        *   BatteryLevelChanged
        *   BatterySaverModeStateChanged
        *   BleScanResultReceived
        *   BleScanStateChanged
        *   ChargingStateChanged
        *   DeviceIdleModeStateChanged
        *   ForegroundServiceStateChanged
        *   GpsScanStateChanged
        *   JobStateChanged
        *   PluggedStateChanged
        *   ScheduledJobStateChanged
        *   ScreenStateChanged
        *   SyncStateChanged
        *   SystemElapsedRealtime
        *   UidProcessStateChanged
        *   WakelockStateChanged
        *   WakeupAlarmOccurred
        *   WifiLockStateChanged
        *   WifiMulticastLockStateChanged
        *   WifiScanStateChanged
    *   [C-0-4] MUST have the device-side adb daemon be inactive by default and
    there MUST be a user-accessible mechanism to turn on the Android Debug
    Bridge.
    *   [C-0-5] MUST support secure adb. Android includes support for secure
    adb. Secure adb enables adb on known authenticated hosts.
    *   [C-0-6] MUST provide a mechanism allowing adb to be connected from a
    host machine. For example:

        *   Device implementations without a USB port supporting peripheral mode
        MUST implement adb via local-area network (such as Ethernet or Wi-Fi).
        *   MUST provide drivers for Windows 7, 9 and 10, allowing developers to
        connect to the device using the adb protocol.

*    [**Dalvik Debug Monitor Service (ddms)**](http://developer.android.com/tools/debugging/ddms.html)
    *   [C-0-7] MUST support all ddms features as documented in the Android SDK.
    As ddms uses adb, support for ddms SHOULD be inactive by default, but
    MUST be supported whenever the user has activated the Android Debug Bridge,
    as above.
*    [**Monkey**](http://developer.android.com/tools/help/monkey.html)
    *   [C-0-8] MUST include the Monkey framework and make it available for
    applications to use.
*    [**SysTrace**](http://developer.android.com/tools/help/systrace.html)
    *   [C-0-9] MUST support the systrace tool as documented in the Android SDK.
    Systrace must be inactive by default and there MUST be a user-accessible
    mechanism to turn on Systrace.

If device implementations report the support of Vulkan 1.0 or higher via the
`android.hardware.vulkan.version` feature flags, they:

*   [C-1-1] MUST provide an affordance for the app developer to enable/disable
    GPU debug layers.
*   [C-1-2] MUST, when the GPU debug layers are enabled, enumerate layers in
    libraries provided by external tools (i.e. not part of the platform or
    application package) found in debuggable applications' base directory to
    support [vkEnumerateInstanceLayerProperties()](
    https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1-extensions/man/html/vkEnumerateInstanceLayerProperties.html)
    and [vkCreateInstance()](
    https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1-extensions/man/html/vkCreateInstance.html)
    API methods.
